            <h2>Calls For Help </h2>
            <p>We have basic mobile phones at Embolden that are pre-loaded with contacts for organisations that can help you. These phones arenâ€™t loaded with credit and only support freephone numbers.</p>
            <p>You may make phone calls for help and support inside our hub room or in the courtyard. If you do not feel comfortable with these options, you may take the phone off-site to make a phone call.</p> 
            <p>Please return the phone once you have finished before closing time so that it can be charged and ready to help somebody else.</p> 
            <p>Please do not delete, add, or otherwise amend the list of contacts.</p> 
            <p>If you speak with an organisation and they need to speak with you again, you could arrange to speak with them at Embolden again if there is not a safe number to call you on.</p> 
            <p>If you would prefer to call from your mobile phone, you can do, but be aware that the organisations number may appear on your itemised phone bill.</p>
            <p>Finally, if your phone use is being restricted or monitored and you are in a position to hide a second phone and think this would benefit you, it may be possible to provide you with one subject to availability. Please email support@embolden.org.uk if this is something that could benefit you.</p>

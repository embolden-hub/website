           <p>If you have injuries that you would like to record, you could ask a friend that you trust to take some for you. Its important to keep the originals and do not edit them. Try to capture the injuries from a range of distances, starting from further away, followed ny mid-range and finally close-up. It's better to take too many than not enough. Avoid cluttered backgrounds where possible, a neutral coloured wall works best.</p>
           <p>Similar to POW, if you would like your injuries photographed, recorded and stored, you can do this through POP.</p>
           <p>We have a designated camera kit at Embolden as well as ForensiGraph rulers for accurately recording injuries. We will store your photographs securly for up to 5 years, on your own unique memory card.</p>
           <p>For more information on POP, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@embolden-hub.org.uk">support@embolden-hub.org.uk</a></p>

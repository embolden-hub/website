        <h2>Safety Freebies</h2>
        <p>If you done left your partner and are in fear for your safety, we may be able to provide you with some resources to increase safety and help with feelings of anxiety. 
These are secured safely, subject to availability and an Embolden volunteer will need to speak with you first and provide you with one.</p>
        <p>Some of the things we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Personal Alarms</b>
                <p>These police approved alarms can attach to a handbag or key-ring or you may wish to hold this or keep it somewhere else close by. 
When activated they let out an extremely loud, 140dB siren to help alert others and get attention.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Window Alarms</b>
                <p>These can help deter forced entry of windows and a 110dB siren will wail if it detects attempted smashing by detecting vibration. 
They are fixed to windows and doors using an adhesive pad.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            content:
            <div>
                <p>Embolden is a code-word scheme which means that when you arrive at the library you should try to ask a member of staff for â€˜Edenâ€™.</p>
                <p>This will give you the privacy of being able to ask for help without other library members aware.</p>
                <p>Keeping the location discrete helps to protect you and keep you safe as well as other women, children, staff and volunteers.</p>
                <p>If you forget though, you can just ask for our hub or support hub.</p>
                <p>Although the library staff and volunteers do not represent Embolden, they are a key part of Embolden and will happily show you to our hub.</p>
            </div>

            title:'What if somebody is already using the hub at Embolden?',

            content:
            <div>
                <p>If we could have any super-power (besides ending domestic abuse and violence once and for all!) it would definitely be the ability to double in size!</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, our main hub room is only big enough to support one woman at a time. Luckily, if this room is occupied, a member of staff can show you to a second room! This wonâ€™t be quite as â€˜Emboldenâ€™ but itâ€™s a safe place to read and make calls.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, the library has computers that can be used for accessing our website and other organisations, including online chat and email services.</p>
                <p>If you would like to make a call outside, you may let a member of staff know and they can show you to the small courtyard.</p>
                <p>Lastly (because we believe in choices!) we can supply you with a basic phone to use off-site for call-making. These phones are pre-loaded with helpline contacts and so only freephone numbers will work. Please ensure this is returned the same day, before close, ready to help somebody else!</p>

               <p>Yes, children are more than welcome under your supervision. We also have a small range of books on domestic abuse for children that you may read together should you wish to. 
                  Our soft Koala bear Cuddles and her little joey are always happy to have friends over to play. </p>

            <div>
                <p>We recommend that you check in at Embolden using our visitors sign in book. It can be helpful to record your visit, especially if you want to refer to it later.</p>
                <p>Security and confidentiality are as important to us, as they are you and so we have a special process to protect your details.</p>
                <p>When you arrive at Embolden, if an Embolden support volunteer is present, we will ask you if you would like to put an entry into our sign in book. We will place this in a secure lockable safe so others who sign in cannot see your entry.</p>
                <p>If the hub is- unwomaned ðŸ˜‰ we have a fancy (yet sturdy!) lockable post box so that you can slip your own sign in entry in. These will be checked multiple times a week and deposited into our safe.</p>

                    <li>Refer you to other local agencies such as Womenâ€™s Aid for help</li>
                    <li>Assist you with form-filling if you would prefer to self-refer and are not feeling confident with filling out.</li>
                    <li>Check for refuge spaces.</li>
                    <li>Help you understand what help and support is available and discuss this with you.</li>
                    <li>Help you make a safety plan should you wish to leave.</li>
                    <li>Help arrange a safe time for you to speak with police at Embolden, or an outreach worker from Womenâ€™s Aid, should you wish to.</li>
                    <li>Help you fill out a Clareâ€™s Law application if you need help or a safe place to do this.</li>
                    <li>Provide you with a safe place to meet with police if there is a Clareâ€™s Law disclosure.</li>

                <p>There will always be a member of staff or volunteer from the library to show you to the hub.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there will be times when our hub is un-womaned for now and so make yourself at home in our hub (you can have a tea, coffee or a cold drink!).</p>

                <p>If you would like to have a chat in person, we recommend emailing ahead of your visit to support@embolden-hub.org.uk so we can arrange a suitable time with you.

                    When speaking with a volunteer at Embolden, what you say will remain confidential, unless you consent to disclosing information to another service. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to do so, if we believe there is an imminent risk to your welfare or the welfare of a child. If this is the case, we will discuss this with you first, so you will never be caught off guard.

                    <p>If you have not been seen at a hospital or doctors or otherwise reported your injuries, you can fill out an incident form that we can store safely. With this, you can document what, when, where, how and any other details that you remember that may prove important if you report domestic violence. For this, we will need to take your details so that we can identify which form belongs to whom.</p>
                    <p>In the near future we may introduce a service where, with your consent, you can have injuries or marks photographed, documented and held securely. For now, if you would like some guidance on how to best capture and store photos, we can guide you on this.</p>

The website is password protected to prevent identifying details about our location being leaked to perpetrators. If we need to change this password in the future, please visit the library and any member of staff will be able to give you the new password.
